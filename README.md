# Mobile-App-Development
Mobile App Development final project.
Nowadays, there is a plethora of different mobile apps and games that people from around the world use to entertain themselves. Over 1.85 million apps exist on Play Market only, but the number of good quality free apps is still limited. For this reason, the decision to create the Quiz game app for the University of Central Asia (UCA) community was taken by our group members. UCA is an institution situated in the middle of the mountains in Naryn region, Kyrgyzstan. The campus of UCA is residential and is normally full of students, faculty and staff, who like spending time with joy, fun and benefit. Therefore, an idea to create a game that will be uniting two most popular activities on campus appeared right away. The aim of the given project is to create an app for entertainment that will be both engaging and intellectually stimulating.
